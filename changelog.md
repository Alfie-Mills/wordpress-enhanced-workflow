# Changelog

This changelog is being recorded after this project has been widely adopted by my own projects. The prior 'version' was always v1.0.0 so for this reason this changelog will kick off from v1.0.1

## v1.0.2
**12/06/20**
- Updates to accommodate the update of Shiftr to v1.1, following new Gulp task names
- Sample `.gitignore` has been cleaned up using globs for excluding WP core files/directories
- The `.code-workspace` file default name has changed to `project-name` as it should be encouraged to use a unique name for these files. This is due to how VS Code displays recent projects, and me not knowing who is who!


## v1.0.1
**02/06/20**
- Added the changelog
- Project now uses MIT License
